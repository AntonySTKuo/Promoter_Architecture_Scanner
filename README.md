# TSS Scanner

**Transcriptional Start Site (TSS) Scanner** is a tool designed to segment and align promoter elements upstream of TSS in bacteria. Detailed algorithms and methodologies are provided in [the accompanying article](url).

In [this article](url), we used various bacterial genomes listed in [**Genome_List.csv**](Genome_List.csv). Their GenBank files are located in the [**genomes**](genomes/) folder. The TSS-mapping data we collected is provided in the [**TSS_List.tsv**](TSS_List.tsv) table.

To reproduce the results presented in the article, run the following Python script:

```bash
python scripts/scanner_multiprocessing.py
```

If you wish to use your own data, replace the [**TSS_List.tsv**](TSS_List.tsv) file with your data and place the corresponding genome GenBank files in the [**genomes**](genomes/) folder.

## Environment

The required environment is specified in [**environment.yml**](environment.yml). To set up the environment using **conda**, run:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
